== Installation ==

After installing the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory, a banner will
show up asking you to log in or sign up. If you have an account, just log in
and choose which of your existing Urtak sites you would like to use. If you’re
signing up, the plugin will automatically create a new Urtak site for you. In
both cases the plugin will also automatically fill in the domain field, which
should be the URL of the domain on which your WordPress site is running. If you
are using the same Urtak site on multiple domains you can add them separated by
a comma. Don’t forget to hit the save changes button at the bottom if you
change any of the settings. You’re ready to go!

= Using the Plugin =

On the post edit page you’ll find a new console from which you can easily add,
approve, reject, or archive your Urtak questions. Each post has an Urtak
associated with it and each Urtak consists of a set of questions. These
questions are served to the user in a random order. A user has to answer the
question in front of her before she can answer another question. Answering
questions does not require a user to be signed up; however, in order to ask
a question, a user must sign up. You, as the publisher, will receive an email
report with usage stats. To view results, either visit the widget on your
published page or your dashboard on Urtak.com where all of your data is stored
and organized.
