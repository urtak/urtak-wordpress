== Installation ==

TODO Sascha

After installing the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory, proceed to
activate the plugin. Just enter your email address, if you are a new user, we
will sign you up automatically and generate an API key for you. If you already
have an account we will help you retrieve your key. Hit "Let's Get Started" and
you are ready to go.

= Settings =

TODO Sascha

Settings can be modified at any time at the Urtak Configuration page, just
click "Toggle Advanced Options" to see them. By default, an Urtak will be
created whenever a user visits your page. It is loaded in the background and
will not slow your page down. If you prefer, you can opt out, and an Urtak will
only be created when you kick off the conversation by asking a question in the
Post interface. The Urtak widget appears underneath your content, but you can
opt to place it on your page manually. Questions will be automatically approved
by community moderation, which prevents manual moderation of each
user-submitted question. If you deselect this option, an e-mail will be sent
each time a question is submitted and you must approve or reject it manually.

= Using the Plugin =

TODO Sascha

When you create a new post, a new Urtak is automatically generated that can be
moderated at anytime within the Post interface. It is simple to get started.
Simply enter a few questions into the question box and you are ready to go. The
more questions your audience answers, the better insight you get and you can
keep them answering by making each question simple, but entertaining. Return to
the Edit Post interface at anytime to moderate questions by approving,
rejecting or marking them as spam. To view results, either visit the widget on
your published page or your dashboard on Urtak.com where all of your data is
stored and organized.
