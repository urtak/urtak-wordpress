== Installation ==

After installing the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory, a banner will
show up asking you to log in or sign up. If you have an account just log in and
choose which of your existing sites you would like to use. If you're signing up
Urtak will automatically create a publication. In both cases the plugin will also
automatically fill in the domain field, which should be the URL of the domain on
which your WordPress site is running. If you are using the same Urtak site on multiple
domains you can add them separated by a comma. Don't forget to hit the save changes
button at the bottom if you change any of the settings. And you're ready to go.

= Using the Plugin =

On the post edit page you'll find a new console from which you can easily add,
approve, reject or archive, your Urtak questions. Each post has an Urtak associated
with it and each Urtak consists of a set of questions. These questions are served to
the user in a random order. A user also has to answer the current question to get a
new one. Answering questions does not to be signed up but to ask a question a user
needs to sign up. You as the publisher will also receive an email report with usage
stats. To view results, either visit the widget on your published page or your
dashboard on Urtak.com where all of your data is stored and organized.
