An Urtak poll is the simplest and fastest way to find out what an online
audience is thinking.

== Description ==

The Urtak plugin for WordPress makes it extremely easy to add, moderate, and
create insights from Urtak polls on your site.

Urtak is the only poll where everyone who participates can ask questions. By
asking your audience simple yes or no questions, and by letting them ask
questions of their own, you can quickly create a valuable resource of opinion
insights.

Urtak is in use by great online publishers like Mashable, The Blaze, The Daily
Beast, CBC, Sports Illustrated, InStyle, Women’s Health, and Andrew Sullivan’s
The Dish.

== Installation ==

You may install Urtak using the built in WordPress plugin installer. You can
also manually install the plugin by uploading it to your `/wp-content/plugins`
directory.

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, an “Urtak” link should appear
in your dashboard’s left navigation menu. In the “Settings” sub-section of the
Urtak plugin, you may sign up for an Urtak account or log in with your existing
credentials if you already have an account.

Once you’ve signed in and completed your selections on the “Settings” page, you
will see an Urtak meta-box on your Post Edit pages from which you can create
Urtak polls.
